This Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to calculate the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS) of patients. The NIHSS is an essential tool in assessing the severity of stroke and helps in guiding treatment decisions. Users can select the patient's response for each category through dropdown menus. The app calculates the total NIHSS score based on these inputs and provides an interpretation of the score range, aiding in the quick assessment of stroke severity. The implementation includes only a subset of the NIHSS items for simplicity and demonstration purposes; a complete tool should cover all the assessment categories defined in the NIHSS.
